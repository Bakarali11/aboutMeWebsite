<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<body>
    <p1>I am a highly motivated, resourceful, and adaptable individual with a range of useful skills. I communicate comfortably and effectively with people on all levels. I am well presented and have good interpersonal skills. I have the confidence and commitment to ensure success in any task undertaken. I work effectively in independent roles but can also work efficiently within team efforts. At high school, I was the captain of the school football team, so I needed to require certain traits to make me a good captain. I am a team leader, I enforced positive thinking and have great composure. I learn new skills quickly and readily and I can apply my knowledge gained effectively and productively.

<p3>Another hobby of mine is football. I like to play football as it keeps me fit and healthy. Furthermore playing football keeps my brain refreshed which allows me to tackle difficult tasks more promptly.
